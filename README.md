# SVPullToRefresh + SVInfiniteScrolling

These UIScrollView categories makes it super easy to add pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling fonctionalities to any UIScrollView (or any of its subclass). Instead of relying on delegates and/or subclassing `UIViewController`, SVPullToRefresh uses the Objective-C runtime to add the following 3 methods to `UIScrollView`:

```objective-c
- (void)addPullToRefreshWithActionHandler:(void (^)(void))actionHandler;
- (void)addPullToRefreshWithActionHandler:(void (^)(void))actionHandler position:(SVPullToRefreshPosition)position;
- (void)addInfiniteScrollingWithActionHandler:(void (^)(void))actionHandler;
```

## Installation

### From CocoaPods

Add `pod 'SVPullToRefresh'` to your Podfile or `pod 'SVPullToRefresh', :head` if you're feeling adventurous.

### From Carthage

Add `github "samvermette/SVPullToRefresh"` to your Cartfile and run `$ carthage update`.

### Manually

_**Important note if your project doesn't use ARC**: you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to `UIScrollView+SVPullToRefresh.m` and `UIScrollView+SVInfiniteScrolling.m` in Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources._

* Drag the `SVPullToRefresh/SVPullToRefresh` folder into your project.
* Add the **QuartzCore** framework to your project.
* Import `UIScrollView+SVPullToRefresh.h` and/or `UIScrollView+SVInfiniteScrolling.h`

## Usage

(see sample Xcode project in `/Demo`)

### Adding Pull to Refresh

```objective-c
[tableView addPullToRefreshWithActionHandler:^{
    // prepend data to dataSource, insert cells at top of table view
    // call [tableView.pullToRefreshView stopAnimating] when done
}];
```
or if you want pull to refresh from the bottom

```objective-c
[tableView addPullToRefreshWithActionHandler:^{
    // prepend data to dataSource, insert cells at top of table view
    // call [tableView.pullToRefreshView stopAnimating] when done
} position:SVPullToRefreshPositionBottom];
```

If you’d like to programmatically trigger the refresh (for instance in `viewDidAppear:`), you can do so with:

```objective-c
[tableView triggerPullToRefresh];
```

You can temporarily hide the pull to refresh view by setting the `showsPullToRefresh` property:

```objective-c
tableView.showsPullToRefresh = NO;
```

#### Customization

The pull to refresh view can be customized using the following properties/methods:

```objective-c
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *arrowColor;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *textColor;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite) UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle activityIndicatorViewStyle;

- (void)setTitle:(NSString *)title forState:(SVPullToRefreshState)state;
- (void)setSubtitle:(NSString *)subtitle forState:(SVPullToRefreshState)state;
- (void)setCustomView:(UIView *)view forState:(SVPullToRefreshState)state;
```

You can access these properties through your scroll view's `pullToRefreshView` property.

For instance, you would set the `arrowColor` property using:

```objective-c
tableView.pullToRefreshView.arrowColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
```

### Adding Infinite Scrolling

```objective-c
[tableView addInfiniteScrollingWithActionHandler:^{
    // append data to data source, insert new cells at the end of table view
    // call [tableView.infiniteScrollingView stopAnimating] when done
}];
```

If you’d like to programmatically trigger the loading (for instance in `viewDidAppear:`), you can do so with:

```objective-c
[tableView triggerInfiniteScrolling];
```

You can temporarily hide the infinite scrolling view by setting the `showsInfiniteScrolling` property:

```objective-c
tableView.showsInfiniteScrolling = NO;
```

#### Customization

The infinite scrolling view can be customized using the following methods:

```objective-c
- (void)setActivityIndicatorViewStyle:(UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle)activityIndicatorViewStyle;
- (void)setCustomView:(UIView *)view forState:(SVInfiniteScrollingState)state;
```

You can access these properties through your scroll view's `infiniteScrollingView` property. 

## Under the hood

SVPullToRefresh extends `UIScrollView` by adding new public methods as well as a dynamic properties. 

It uses key-value observing to track the scrollView's `contentOffset`.
